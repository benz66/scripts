# This is a simple script repository.

I will be using this to add useful scripts that I develop as part of my learning journey which will consist mainly of PowerShell and Python scripts and Aure Resource Manager (ARM) templates. I will also being using to improve my knowledge of Git and GitHub.

## Structure

I will create a simple folder structure using README.md files but may extend or improve that process going forward.

## Adding a new change to test branch rename

I have renamed my main branch to master and want to ensure that everything works as expected.
